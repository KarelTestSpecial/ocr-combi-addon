To all technically skilled users:

README.md within CODE folder : you can install it locally and use it.

----- 
 
To all developers :

Please feel free to set up the project as a Google Chrome Web Store extension . 

I myself have no personal webdomain which is a new requirement by Google for oAuth-verification for extensions that use Google/YouTube API's via the Google Cloud Platform (since Manifest v3).

It is a good program and I use it locally (which is allowed by Google) and I think it would be benificial to the community if someone made a publically available Chrome extension out of it.


Many greetings,
